//The Redux store holds the application's entire state tree. You create it by passing your root reducer to createStore (or configureStore with Redux Toolkit).

// store/index.js
import { createStore } from 'redux'; // Or configureStore from @reduxjs/toolkit
import counterReducer from '../reducers';

const store = createStore(counterReducer); // Or configureStore({ reducer: counterReducer });

export default store;
